	OBJECTIVE
		Use object oriented programming techniques in the
	implementation of a boardgame based game.
		The program should be easy to read and have an
	obvious logic.


	IMPLEMENTATION
		I am using an already implemented read/write method.
		All the logic in the game is implemented in the
	Game.SheriffOfNottingham function. The name of the functions are
	chosen to be self-explanatory and there are comments through-out
	the code to explain what is happening.
		For the players type i chose to use a super class Player
	and extend it with every type of player: Basic, Greedy and Bribed;
	and override the specific actions for them.
		The GoodFactory SingleTone is perfectly placed in this
	implementation, because we only need to have one good factory instance.
		I am also using a Constants class for all the constants i
	need to use.
		I did not focus on efficiency. Instead i wanted to write a
	more readable and scalable code.
